## **Observations:**

The following tasks are unfinished.

## **User Story #12: Check Enrolment Status**

As a student, I want to check the course enrollment status to decide whether to enroll in the course or join the waitlist. 

**Criteria of satisfaction**: 
The courses section should display the status of the section, for example: Seats Available, Full, or Waitlist.
Enrolment status updates automatically as seats fill or become available.
All changes should be reflected in real-time for students.

## **User Story #13: Academic Progress Tracker**
As a student, I want to see my academic progress so that I can plan my degree according to the number of courses I have completed and the number left over.

**Criteria of satisfaction**: 
The progress tracker displays completed courses, remaining courses, and credits earned.
Once the course is completed, the tracker should update it automatically.

## **User Story#14 : Rate the Professor**

As a student, I want to rate the professor, and I want to write down the reviews and how my experience with this professor was. 

**Criteria of satisfaction:** 
The professor can just read the reviews and check the ratings but cannot edit them. Students can write down reviews about the professor according to their experience, and it should reflect it in real-time. 

## **Practices to Continue:**

**Early Integration:**
To identify the issues sooner, we begin the backend and frontend integration on time.

**Improved Task Breakdown:**
We divided the larger tasks into smaller tasks and did the prioritization for the tasks. In this way, we did the high-priority tasks first, then medium and then lower.

**Parallel Task Execution:**
Assigning related tasks to multiple team members to work in parallel. In this way, we saved so much time and were able to complete more tasks on time. 

## **New Practices to Adopt:**

**Collaborative Debugging:**
We should work more on collaborative debugging. Because it helps a lot and saves a lot of time. 

**Tasks Reviews Before Start Developing:**
We should review the tasks before starting to work on the developing part. 

## **Practices to Stop:**

**Underestimating Task Development:**
We faced delays because we underestimated the complexity of the tasks.

**Limiting Testing Time:**
Because of everyone's busy schedule, we have very limited time to test the code. Which was frustrating. 

## **Best/Worst Experiences:**

**Best:**
It was fun to work with the group; we developed a good understanding of how to work as a team, how to handle deadlines, and how to do teamwork. Despite the challenges we faced during this time, we tried our best to deliver the quality of work. 

**Worst:**
We underestimated the complexity of some of the tasks, which was a little bit frustrating for a moment. However, we were able to overcome the obstacles by working together and ultimately make it work.
