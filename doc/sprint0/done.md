# Definition Of Done 
The definition of done.md is a shared understanding of all user stories within our team, and it reflects the feature requirements. After discussing with my teammates, we came up with this idea.
1. Complete Code: Ensure the code meets specifications and implements functionalities.
2. Functionality: The feature should function according to the user stories described.
3. Code assessment: All team members should evaluate the code and accept suggestions openly.
4. Documentation: The code will be documented in the README.md.
5. Integration: The feature is incorporated into the main branch without leading to any GitHub conflicts.
6. Quality of Code: The code is tidy and error-free. Others should be able to understand it easily.
