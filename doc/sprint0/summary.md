## Project Objectives:
This project aims to develop a user-centric app that simplifies the course selection, professor information, GPA requirements, enrollment actions (add/remove, drop, or switch sections), and semester management process for students at York University, enhancing their academic planning and experience.

## Key Users: 
1. Students: primary users—who access course information, view professor's ratings, manage class enrollments, and plan the degree. 
2. Teaching Assistants: Secondary users who assist the students with their academic planning
3. Professors/Instructors: User—they can review the planner to ensure the course details are accurate. 

## Key Usage Scenarios:
* Scenario 1: A student views the prerequisite list for an advanced course to determine if they are eligible to enrol or need additional courses beforehand.
* Scenario 2: A student checks different sections of a course to find a time that fits their current schedule and preferences.
* Scenario 3: A student uses the planner to view professor ratings and class details before selecting a section to ensure it aligns with their learning style and schedule.
* Scenario 4: During the add/drop period, a student decides to switch sections or courses, using the planner to efficiently update their registration.
* Scenario 5: An academic advisor assists a student by checking the planner to ensure they are meeting program requirements and adjusting their course plan accordingly.
* 
## Principles: 
1. View Course Prerequisites: Students check prerequisites to determine eligibility and prepare for future semesters.
2. Access Professor Information: Students view professor profiles, previous student reviews, and contact information to gauge course expectations.
3. Add/Drop/Move Courses: Students modify their course schedule by adding or dropping classes, or changing sections based on availability.
4. Check Class Details: Students view details like location, time, and availability to avoid schedule conflicts.
5. Plan Semester Schedule: Students create a comprehensive schedule that satisfies their academic requirements and personal preferences.
6. Rate the professors.
7. Advising Sessions: An academic advisor or TA uses the planner to help the students and ensure they are meeting the requirements and answering the student's inquiries.
