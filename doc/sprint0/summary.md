## Project Objectives:
Our goal is to create an intuitive tool that will make academic preparation easier for York University students. The software will offer a full semester management tool and expedite enrollment operations (add, drop, and move sections), professor information, GPA requirements, and course selection. In this way, the software improves students' academic experience and planning effectiveness.

## Key Users: 
1. Students: The main users who depend on the app for degree planning, enrollment management, professor ratings, and course information.
2. Academic advisors: Help students organize their studies and offer advice on program requirements and course choices.
3. Instructors and professors: Check the app to make sure the course information is correct and current.

## Key Usage Scenarios:
* Eligibility Check for Advanced Courses: To verify their eligibility or identify further courses they need to take, students look at the requirements for a course.
* Choosing a Section Based on Schedule: Students look at many course sections to determine a class time that works for their preferences and actual schedule.
* Review of the Course and Professors for an Informed Choice: Students look at course information and professor ratings to select sections that suit their availability and learning preferences.
* Adjustments for Adds and Drops: Students utilize the app to quickly transfer between sections or modify their course registration during this time.
* Support for Advising Sessions: An academic adviser helps a student by looking over their course schedule, making sure all program requirements are fulfilled, and making any adjustments.
* 
## Principles: 
1. View Course Prerequisites: Students check prerequisites to determine eligibility and prepare for future semesters.
2. Access Professor Information: Students view professor profiles, previous student reviews, and contact information to gauge course expectations.
3. Add/Drop/Move Courses: Students modify their course schedule by adding or dropping classes, or changing sections based on availability.
4. Check Class Details: Students view details like location, time, and availability to avoid schedule conflicts.
5. Plan Semester Schedule: Students create a comprehensive schedule that satisfies their academic requirements and personal preferences.
6. Rate the professors.
7. Advising Sessions: An academic advisor or TA uses the planner to help the students and ensure they are meeting the requirements and answering the student's inquiries.
