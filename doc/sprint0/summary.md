## Project Objectives:
Our goal is to create an intuitive tool that will make academic preparation easier for York University students. The software will offer a full semester management tool and expedite enrollment operations (add, drop, and move sections), professor information, GPA requirements, and course selection. In this way, the software improves students' academic experience and planning effectiveness.

## Key Users: 
1. Students: The main users who depend on the app for degree planning, enrollment management, professor ratings, and course information.
2. Academic advisors: Help students organize their studies and offer advice on program requirements and course choices.
3. Instructors and professors: Check the app to make sure the course information is correct and current.

## Key Usage Scenarios:
* Scenario 1: A student views the prerequisite list for an advanced course to determine if they are eligible to enrol or need additional courses beforehand.
* Scenario 2: A student checks different sections of a course to find a time that fits their current schedule and preferences.
* Scenario 3: A student uses the planner to view professor ratings and class details before selecting a section to ensure it aligns with their learning style and schedule.
* Scenario 4: During the add/drop period, a student decides to switch sections or courses, using the planner to efficiently update their registration.
* Scenario 5: An academic advisor assists a student by checking the planner to ensure they are meeting program requirements and adjusting their course plan accordingly.

## Principles: 
1. View Course Prerequisites: Students check prerequisites to determine eligibility and prepare for future semesters.
2. Access Professor Information: Students view professor profiles, previous student reviews, and contact information to gauge course expectations.
3. Add/Drop/Move Courses: Students modify their course schedule by adding or dropping classes, or changing sections based on availability.
4. Check Class Details: Students view details like location, time, and availability to avoid schedule conflicts.
5. Plan Semester Schedule: Students create a comprehensive schedule that satisfies their academic requirements and personal preferences.
6. Rate the professors.
7. Advising Sessions: An academic advisor or TA uses the planner to help the students and ensure they are meeting the requirements and answering the student's inquiries.
