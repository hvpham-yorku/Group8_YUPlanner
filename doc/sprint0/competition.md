-**Description:** VSB is an online self-serve tool that helps students search for courses, visualize schedule combinations, and avoid timing conflicts by displaying possible course schedules in an easy to navigate format.
-**Limitations:** 
  - Students must manually register for their chosen courses in a separate module (REM), adding extra steps to the process
  - While it includes details like prerequisites, GPA requirements, professor names, and section availability, students 
    must know course codes beforehand, as there is no searchable course list

### York University REM 
-**Link:** [York University REM](https://wrem.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/REM.woa/wa/DirectAction/rem)
-**Description:** A module that allows York University students to add, drop, transfer, or exchange courses by entering the course catalog number. Before proceeding, it asks for your academic year and whether you are an undergrad or grad student.
-**Limitations:** 
  - Students must know their course catalog numbers and enter them manually, which can be tedious
  - It lacks a visual interface for managing class schedules, so students have to plan beforehand
  - Limited information about courses requires students to use multiple resources for course, professor, and 
    availability information

### Rate My Professors

-**Description:** A platform that allows students to review and rate professors based on their experiences. Students can get insights into the effectiveness of the professors’ teaching and overall satisfaction, which can help them choose courses and instructors. 
-**Limitations:**
  - Lacks specific course information and prerequisite details, which requires students to consult other resources
  - There is no integration with course registrations

### CourseDelta
-**Link:** [CourseDelta](https://coursedelta.yorku.dev/)
-**Description:** This website visualizes course prerequisites through a skill tree format, showing all necessary courses and their relationships. It can help with long-term academic planning by confirming prerequisite paths for any department of your choosing.
-**Limitations:**
  - Focuses solely on prerequisite mapping and lacks features for scheduling and registration, which makes it less 
    useful for course management

## How Our Product Is Different
Our product sets itself apart by offering an all-in-one integrated platform that combines course scheduling, registration, and prerequisite visualization into one cohesive user experience. Unlike the existing solutions, YUPlanner provides an easy transition from exploring courses to registering for them, thus saving time for students and reducing frustration. Students will be able to browse through a list of courses, complete with prerequisites and GPA requirements. Additionally, students can read integrated feedback on professors to help students make decisions about their course selections. Once selected, our tool allows students to build their schedule visually, all on one application.

## Target Users and Scenarios
Our primary users include:
  - **New and Current Students:** Students who may find it challenging to navigate York University’s course catalog to select appropriate courses. Our platform simplifies this process with user-friendly search features.
  - **Busy Students:** Students who are balancing coursework, jobs, and clubs would require efficient tools to manage their schedules. Our product allows them to quickly find and register for classes without unnecessary delays.
  - **Complex Schedules:** Students that are pursuing dual majors or minors would require attention to detail over course requirements, which can be daunting. Our platform provides a clear visualization, making it easier to plan ahead and meet graduation requirements.

## Competitors’ Focus
Competitors have not concentrated on specific user needs and scenarios primarily due to their limited understanding of challenges students face in course selection. Many existing tools focus solely on either course information or registration, failing to provide a solution that addresses all aspects of course management. This approach misses opportunities to enhance user experience. In addition, competitors may lack insights into student needs, resulting in features that are not with user expectations. To address these gaps, competitors would need to engage in user research to better understand the needs of their audience and create a system that integrates multiple functionalities to have a competitive edge in the market.
